# Cryptographic Banking Application: Zero-Knowledge Proof for \( N = p 	imes q \) with Large Prime Factors

In this project, we explore various primality testing methods as foundational components in cryptographic banking applications. Specifically, we implement Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to verify the primality of large numbers, with a final objective of constructing a ZKP to validate \( N = p 	imes q \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are large primes.

Circom is used to implement these proofs, and this repository contains both the circuits and scripts to generate and verify certificates of primality. Contributions for optimization and further testing are welcome.

## Primality Testing Methods

1. **Fermat Primality Test**  
   - **Algorithm**: Uses Fermat's Little Theorem, asserting that if \( a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \ (	ext{mod} \ n) \) for several random bases \( a \), \( n \) is likely prime.
   - **Pros**: Simple and efficient for small numbers.
   - **Cons**: Can produce pseudoprimes, which falsely pass as primes.

2. **Lehmann Primality Test**  
   - **Algorithm**: Combines Fermat's method with an additional condition: for a chosen base \( a \), \( a^{(n-1)/2} \) should be \( \pm1 \ (	ext{mod} \ n) \).
   - **Pros**: More accurate than Fermatâ€™s test.
   - **Cons**: Still not fully reliable for all composites.

3. **Rabin-Miller Primality Test**  
   - **Algorithm**: A probabilistic test that decomposes \( n-1 \) into \( 2^s 	imes d \) and checks bases \( a \) for nontrivial square roots of 1 mod \( n \).
   - **Pros**: Highly accurate and widely used in practice.
   - **Cons**: Probabilistic, though accuracy improves with more rounds.

4. **Pratt Primality Certificate**  
   - **Algorithm**: A deterministic method based on recursively proving the primality of factors of \( n-1 \) and confirming nontrivial roots modulo \( n \).
   - **Pros**: Offers a certificate of primality, verifiable in polynomial time.
   - **Cons**: Computationally intense for very large numbers.

## Project Structure

- **scripts/**: Python scripts implementing each primality test and generating certificates (for Pratt).
- **circom/**: Circom circuits for each test, enabling ZKP generation.
- **makefiles/**: Scripts to run each method, step-by-step or in batch.
- **inputs/**: JSON input files, e.g., `pratt.json`, containing values and certificates.

## Usage

To use a specific test, e.g., the Pratt certificate, run the following:

```bash
make -f makefiles/makefile_pratt
```

To clean up generated files:

```bash
make -f makefiles/makefile_pratt clean
```

Run each test with caution as large inputs require high processing power.

### Example Commands

To generate and verify ZKP using Pratt certificate, ensure all Circom dependencies are in place, then use:
